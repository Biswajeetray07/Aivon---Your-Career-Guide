I see you've shared a massive amount of context, including roadmaps for a food ordering app, Docker setups, GitHub PAT guides, and detailed explanations for building an elite LeetCode-style judge (including solutions for problems like Palindrome, Zigzag, Median of Two Sorted Arrays, Word Ladder, etc.)!

Since we just successfully hardened the actual backend execution pipeline (fixing the `ECONNRESET` and timeout drops), we already have the `compareElite` comparator, multi-test batching, and `safeExec` wrappers active in the codebase.

**What would you like to focus on next?**
1. **Adding new problem templates** (e.g., adding `graph.py` or `custom.py` for more complex problems like Course Schedule).
2. **Seeding the new problems** (Median of Two Sorted Arrays, Word Ladder, Longest Valid Parentheses, Course Schedule II) into your database.
3. **Debugging a specific new error** you've encountered while testing the platform.
4. Something entirely different!

Let me know what your immediate priority is!
